treatment(asthma, 'Treatment: Long-term asthma control medications include Inhaled corticosteroids, Leukotriene modifiers, Long-acting beta agonists. Quick-relief medications include Short-acting beta agonists and Ipratropium (Atrovent).').
treatment(cirrhosis, 'Treatment: A low-sodium diet and medication to prevent fluid buildup in the body may help control ascites and swelling. People with cirrhosis caused by excessive alcohol use should try to stop drinking.').
treatment(coeliac, 'Treatment: The only treatment for celiac disease is to follow a gluten-free diet—that is, to avoid all foods that contain gluten.').
treatment(bronchitis, 'Treatment: Adults may take aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen to reduce fever and general feelings of illness, but children should take only acetaminophen or ibuprofen, not aspirin, because children taking aspirin are at higher risk for Reye syndrome.').
treatment(pneumonia, 'Treatment: Hospital treatment may include: intravenous antibiotics injected into a vein respiratory therapy, which involves delivering specific medications directly into the lungs or teaching you to perform breathing exercises to maximize your oxygenation oxygen therapy to maintain oxygen levels in your bloodstream (received through a nasal tube, face mask, or ventilator, depending on severity).').
treatment(flu, 'Treatment: Usually, you will need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu.
